# 🧪 Pathology ETL Demo (Python + Pandas)

This project simulates a basic ETL process for pathology test results using Python (pandas). It includes:

- Loading raw test data
- Cleaning and formatting
- Handling missing values (NULL)
- Weekly summary reporting

## 📁 Included File

- `pathology_etl_cleaning_en.ipynb`: Complete data cleaning and reporting notebook

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated

- pandas: `groupby`, `fillna`, `to_datetime`, `pivot_table`
- Handling NULL values and standardizing dates
- Reporting: weekly test counts and positive rates

This notebook can be extended into an AWS-based pipeline (S3 → Glue → Athena) as a data engineering project.
